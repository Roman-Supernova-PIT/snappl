        INDEXING IMAGES
        ---------------

        For discussion of pixel positions below, remember the
        conventions for astronomical arrays.  Consider four points:

        First, in python, numpy arrays are 0-indexed.  That is, if you
        have a 3-element numpy array named arr, the first element of the
        array is arr[0], the second arr[1], and the last arr[2].  Some
        other languages (e.g. FORTRAN) assume 1-indexed arrays.  That
        is, the first element of FORTRAN array A is A[1], not A[0].
        This matters for us because we are using some astronomical
        formats that have been around since everybody spoke Latin and
        everybody programmed in FORTRAN, so there are some legacy
        conventions left over.  Some libraries (e.g. galsim) at least
        sometimes require you to specify array indexes (such as pixel
        positions) assuming 1-indexed arrays.  Be very careful and read
        lots of documentation!  If we've done it right, everything in
        snpit_utils and snappl uses standard python numpy 0-based array
        indexes, so you will hopefully not become confused.  What's more
        more, the astropy.wcs.WCS class also uses the convention of
        0-based arrays.  (However, be careful, because astropy.wcs has
        an alternate interface that uses the other convention.)

        Another place you will find 1-indexed arrays are in the WCSes
        defined in FITS headers, and in at least some FITS image display
        programs.  If you use ds9 (the standard FITS image display
        program), and hover your pointer over the center of the
        lower-left pixel, you will notice that it tells you it's at
        (1.0,1.0).  This means that if you're reading positions off of
        ds9, you always have to be careful to mentally convert when
        comparing to positions in your code!  Likewise, if you try to
        manually apply the WCS transformation from a FITS header (doing
        the matrix multiplication yourself, rather than relying on a
        snappl or astropy library), you have to make sure you're using
        1-offset pixel coordinates.  Generally, you will not have to
        worry about this; the WCS classes in snappl (just as in astropy)
        will internally take care of all these off-by-1 errors.  As
        stated above, all snappl classes assume 0-based array indexing.

        **If you find yourself manually correcting for 1-offset pixel
        positions in your code, there's a good chance you're doing it
        wrong.**

        Second, following how numpy arrays are indexed, the lower-left
        pixel of an astronomical image is at x=0, y=0.  Furthermore, by
        convention, the *center* of the lower-left pixel is at x=0.0,
        y=0.0.  That means that for a 512Ã—512 image, the whole array
        spans (-0.5,-0.5) to (511.5,511.5); the lower-left corner of the
        array, which is the lower-left corner of the lower-left pixel,
        is at (-0.5,-0.5).

        Third, because numpy arrays are (by default) stored in "row
        major" format, their indexing is *backwards* from what we might
        expect.  That is, to get to pixel (x,y) on a numpy array image,
        you'd do image[y,x].

        Fourth, it follows that a pixel position whose fractional part
        is *exactly* 0.5 is right on the edge between two pixels.  For
        example, the position x=0.5, y=0.5 is the corner between the
        four lower-left-most pixels on the image.  If you want to ask
        for "the closest pixel center" in this case, there is an
        ambiguity, so we have to pick a convention; that convention is
        described below.

        PSF CENTERING FOR get_stamp
        ---------------------------

        If (x0, y0) are not given, the PSF will be centered as best
        possible on the stamp*.  So, if x ends in 0.8, it will be left
        of center, and if x ends in 0.2, it will be right of center.  If
        the fractional part of x or y is exactly 0.5, there's an
        ambituity as to where on the image you should place the stamp of
        the PSF.  The position of the PSF on the returned stamp will
        always round *down* in this case.  (The pixel on the image that
        corresponds to the center pixel on the clip is at
        floor(x+0.5),floor(y+0.5), *not* round(x+0.5),round(y+0.5).
        Those two things are different, and round is not consistent.
        round(i.5) will round up if i is odd, but down if i is even.
        This makes it very difficult to understand where your PSF is; by
        using floor(x+0.5), we get consistent results regardless of
        whether the integer part of x is even or odd.)

        For further discusison of centering, see the discusison of the
        (x0, y0) parameters below.

        * "The PSF will be centered as best possible on the stamp": this
          is only true if the PSF itself is intrinsically centered.  See
          OversampledImagePSF.create for a discussion of
          non-intrinsically-centered PSFs.

        Parameters
        ----------
          x, y: floats
            Position on the image of the center of the psf.  If not
            given, defaults to something sensible that was defined when
            the object was constructed.  If you want to do sub-pixel
            shifts, then the fractional part of x will (usually) not be
            0.

          x0, y0: int, default None
            The pixel position on the image corresponding to the center
            pixel of the returned PSF.  If either is None, they default
            to x0=floor(x+0.5) and y0=floor(y+0.5).  (See above for why
            we don't use round().)

            For example: if you call psfobj.get_stamp(111., 113.), and
            if the PSF object as a clip_size of 5, then you will get
            back an image that looks something like:

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | |o|O|o| |
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------

             the PSF is centered on the center pixel of the clip
             (i.e. 2,2), and that pixel should get placed on pixel
             (x,y)=(111,113) of the image for which you're rendering a
             PSF.  (Suppose you wanted to add this as an injected source
             to the image; in that case, you'd add the returned PSF clip
             to image[111:116,109:114] (remembering that numpy arrays of
             astronomical images using all the defaults that we use in
             this software are indexed [y,x]).)

             If you want an offset PSF, then you would use a different
             x0, y0.  So, if you call psfobj.get_stamp(111., 113.,
             x0=112, y0=114), you'd get back:

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   |.|o|.| | |
                   -----------
                   |o|O|o| | |
                   -----------
                   |.|o|.| | |
                   -----------

             In this case, center pixel of the returned stamp
             corresponds to pixel (x,y)=(112,114) on the image, but the
             PSF is supposed to be centered at (x,y)=(111,113).  So, the
             PSF is one pixel down and to the left of the center of the
             returned stamp.  If you wanted to add this as an injected
             source on to the image, you'd add the PSF clip to
             image[112:117,110:116] (again, remembering that numpy
             arrays are indexed [y,x]).

             If you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.5,113.5), then you'd get
             back something like:

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | |.|.| | |
                   -----------
                   |.|o|o|.| |
                   -----------
                   |.|o|o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | |.|.| | |
                   -----------

            Because your pixel position ended in (0.5, 0.5), the PSF is
            centered on the corner of the pixel.  The center of the clip
            (x,y)=(2,2) corresponds to (floor(111.5+0.5), floor(113.5+0.5))
            on the image, or (x,y)=(112,114).

            If you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.5, 113.5, x0=111, y0=113)
            then you'd get back a clip:

                   -----------
                   | | |.|.| |
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|o|.|
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|o|.|
                   -----------
                   | | |.|.| |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------

           Finally, to belabor the point, a couple of more examples.  If
           you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.25, 113.0), you'd get back a
           clip with the peak of the psf at (x,y)=(2.25,2.0) on the
           thumbnail image, with the center pixel corresponding to
           (x,y)=(floor(111.25+0.5), floor(113.+0.5)), or (111,113).
           You would add it to image[111:116,109:114], and the stamp
           would look like:

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | | |o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | |.|O|o|.|
                   -----------
                   | | |o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------

            If you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.25, 113.0, x0=110, y0=114),
            then you'd get a PSF back with the peak of the PSF on the
            clip at (x,y)=(3.5,1.0), the center pixel corresponding to
            (x,y)=(110,114) on the image, and a clip that looks like:

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | | | |o|.|
                   -----------
                   | | |.|O|o|
                   -----------
                   | | | |o|.|
                   -----------


          flux: float, default 1.
             The sum of the PSF before it's rendered into the clip.  For
             some PSF subclasses, this is basically the same as saying
             "the sum of the returned clip is this".  However, if you
             have a non-zero (x0,y0) such that the natural size of the
             PSF slops off of the edge of the returned clip, those two
             things could easily be different.

          x, y: float
            Position on the source image where this PSF is evaluated.
            Required.  Most of the time, but not always, you probably
            want x and y to be integer values.  (As in, not integer
            typed, but floats that satisfy x-floor(x)=0.)  These are
            also the defaults that get_stamp will use if x and y are not
            passed to get_stamp.

            If x and/or y have nonzero fractional parts, then the data
            array must be consistent.  First consider non-oversampled
            data.  Suppose you pass a 11Ã—11 array with x=1022.5 and
            y=1023.25.  In this case, the peak of a perfectly symmetric
            PSF image on data would be at (4.5, 5.25).  (Not (5.5,
            5.25)!  If something's at *exactly* .5, always round down
            here regardless of wheter the integer part is even or odd.)
            The center pixel and the one to the right of it should have
            the same brightness, and the pixel just below center should
            be dimmer than the pixel just above center.

            For oversampled psfs, the data array must be properly
            shifted to account for non-integral x and y.  The shift will
            be as in non-oversampled data, only multiplied by the
            oversampling factor.  So, in the same example, if you
            specify a peak of (4.5, 5.25), and you have an oversampling
            factor of 3, you should pass a 33Ã—33 array with the peak of
            the PSF (assuming a symmetric PSF) at (14.5, 16.75).

          oversample_factor: float, default 1.
            There are this many pixels along one axis in data for one pixel in the original image.
