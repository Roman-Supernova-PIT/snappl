  # Comment from Cole & Rob: This is a path to the SEDs that were used to generate the
  # OU24 simulations. It is not currently stored in any particular place, so this
  # path will likely change in the future. If you are interested in getting the SEDs yourself,
  # run the command:
  # curl https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/groups/rubin/static/sim-data/sed_library/seds_170124.....gz  | tar -C rubin_sim_data/sims_sed_library -xz
